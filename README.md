# Smart Tic Tac Toe
A simple Tic-Tac-Toe game with an implemented ai agent.

## Specifications
Python Vers. 3.9  
Packages:  
Numpy  
...

## Tasks:
#### 1. Program  a simple Tic-Tac_Toe game 
- If you are a bit lazy you can use our game --> [ttt_game.py](https://github.com/United-AI/smart_tictactoe/blob/main/ttt_game.py)
#### 2. Create an intelligent agent for tic tac toe. 
- Start with the Q Learning algorithm  
You can find a tutorial here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMk_XtIEzH8&list=PLQVvvaa0QuDezJFIOU5wDdfy4e9vdnx-7

- Try to integrate Q learning into the tic tac toe game.
You can find our solution here --> [ttt_qlearning.py](https://github.com/United-AI/smart_tictactoe/blob/main/ttt_qlearning.py)

The next step will be to extend Q learning with a neural network to create a deep Q learning algorithm.
